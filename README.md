# Pokémon Outlier Detection 🧢⚡

Discover unusual Pokémon using unsupervised machine learning!  
This project identifies Pokémon statistical outliers by analyzing their base stats and physical attributes using PCA for dimensionality reduction and DBSCAN for clustering.

## 📚 Project Overview

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Pokémon dataset.
- Scale features and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Auto-tune DBSCAN clustering parameters to detect natural outliers.
- Visualize clusters and highlight special Pokémon.
- Analyze detected outliers and explore future extensions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn (PCA, DBSCAN)
- matplotlib, seaborn

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Compare species strength across Pokémon types (e.g., Dragon vs Bug).
- Handle Pokémon with dual types in a smarter way.
- Separate clustering by Legendary, Mythical, Ultra Beast, and Pseudo-Legendary groups.
- Experiment with alternative algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, t-SNE).
- Build a Pokémon Dream Team recommender system!
